			<h1 style="clear:both;">Enzyme Catalysis and Flexibility</h1> 
			
			<section>
			Flexibility is one of the most intriguing characteristics of enzymes and is in many cases required in order to undergo
			conformational changes as a requisite for substrate binding and release. However, enzymes must be stable enough to retain 
			their 3D structure, but flexible enough to permit the evolution of the protein among the different conformations relevant 
			at each step for the catalytic process (1,2). A rather controversial question is the impact of this flexibility on the 
			rate constants (3-13):
									$$k_r = \frac{k_BT}{h}e^{\frac{\Delta G^\ddagger}{RT}} =\frac{k_BT}{h}e^{\frac{\Delta H^\ddagger - T\Delta S^\ddagger}{RT}} $$ 	   
			where $h$, $k_B$ and $R$ are the Planck, Boltzman and gas constants. By only considering 
									$$\Delta G^\ddagger = \Delta H^\ddagger - T\Delta S^\ddagger $$	
			
			it is clear that increased ground state flexibility will lead to a decrease in $\Delta S^\ddagger$ as the system goes to the transition state (TS). A more negative
			$\Delta S^\ddagger$ will increase the activation free energy, and consequently counteract the catalysis along the reaction coordinate (reduce $k_r$). It is 
			however a rather common understanding that proteins need a certain degree of reorganization to attain TS (13). The idea is that the coordinates describing the transformation
			from reactants to products is a collective coordinate that involves degrees of freedom for both the solute/substrate and the surrounding environment. 
			
			<p>
				In an uncatalyzed reaction where only water surrounds the reacting fragments, it is clear that the surroundings need to reorganize their dipoles and electrostatic interactions
				in acoordance with the reaction coordinate for the reaction to proceed. Obviously, enzymes do not have randomly distributed dipoles as they are preorganized in some way
				from the folding process. It is becoming a more established undestanding that enzymes are preorganized in accordance with the reaction coordinate of the catalytic mechanism, 
				and it was reported by Adamczyk et. al. that enzyme catalysis arises from electrostatic preorganization and not from conformational motions (11). If we do not take into 
				account the actual binding and release of the substrate, this implies that, since the flexibility counteracts the activation free energies, a frozen enzyme reaction should result in lowering
				the activation free energies. A recent publication from Garcia-Meseguer et al. reported that the $S_N2$ enzyme catalyzed reaction would be significantly more difficult in a
				frozen protein environment in which the solvent coordinate remain unchanged from the reactant state (RS) to TS (14). This means that protein flexibility plays a role in catalysis
				and that the environment needs to be rearranged when going from RS to TS to reach maximum reduction in the activation free energy. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Enzyme flexibility is necessary for binding and release of substrates, but wetter or not this flexibility actually is required for optimal catalysis along the reaciton coordinate is
				still controversial. If enzymes are preorganized towards TS it is logical to think that flexibility has an unfavorable effect on $\Delta G^\ddagger$. Nevertheless, if some degree of reorganization
				is required for optimal reaction rates, it is clear from the above mentioned references, that this reorganization energy is significantly lower in enzymes compared to the uncatalyzed reaction in water.
				If enzymes are completely preorganized or if some degree of reorganization is required for optimal catalysis thus seem to be two fronting edges within this research field these days.
